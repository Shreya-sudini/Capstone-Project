**Project Goals**:

* Utilize predictive modeling to enhance Diabetes management.
* Address Diabetes, a serious epidemic, impacting millions of individuals who are often unaware of their risk, making predictive modeling crucial for timely and critical intervention.

**Methodology**:

* Employing Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting algorithm, CATBoost, and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop predictive models for identifying individuals at high risk of Type II Diabetes.
* Models evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Analyze contributing factors to Type II Diabetes and provide actionable recommendations for intervention strategies.

**Expected Results**:

Neural Networks may give out best results out of the 4 algorithms.
